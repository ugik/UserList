== UserList prototype: accessing Keas model data

UserList is a prototype showing access to the Keas models and associations in rails. This
prototype shows examples of the following:

- remote access to MySQL database (requires native mysql gem install)
- optimized non-SQL access to relational table data
- replication of the Keas model associations for remote access
- use of a local table (Admin) associated with remote tables through associations
- caching for expensive pages
- Google graphics library examples (both Javascript and Flash)
- production deployment (heroku) of heterogeneous data (local and remote)
- use of stateful cookie setting

'Kiosk' mode
The graphs can be shown in an automated mode, refreshing every 30secs. 
To set this up: first clear cookies by updating any admin, then click 'show' on the league id's that 
you want to cycle through, by showing each you add them to a list that will be cycled through.
Force .../0 in the URL for admins to enter kiosk mode, to exit, enter .../1 in the URL

Note: 
- mysql gem must be natively built and gem installed for access to remote db
- for Google graphs, add to gemfile: 
		gem "google_visualr", "~> 2.1.0" 
  and <script src='http://www.google.com/jsapi'></script>  to ../layouts/application.html.erb
